      "message": "nova itself doesn\u0027t need virsh but it\u0027s used to configure compute nodes by puppet-nova, puppet-tripleo, packstack (probably openstack-ansible) and any script that administrators may have done for monitoring etc... Also administrators commonly use it to troubleshoot issues. For backwards compatibility i think the best option is add the requirement here.",

The impact is very low, it\u0027s a small package with no security impact and note that some of the tools that require virsh are not consumed as rpm packages where we can add the dependency so we need to fix it in a different and more complex way.",
