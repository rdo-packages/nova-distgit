      "message": "Andrea,\n\nThanks a lot for the contribution, we always appreciate outside help. We also appreciate proactive help like this, and the well documented submission.\n\nThere\u0027s a couple of nitpicks that I\u0027ve documented below.\n\nAnd regarding the security concern, I believe the the original way is more secure and let me explain:\n- A rogue ssh client can only execute what it\u0027s able to pass to the remote host.\n- By strictly checking the command, we make sure they can only execute these specific commands.\n- Unless they already have access to the host and can overwrite these commands, their impact is pretty limited\n- By using regex like this, I believe that it\u0027s possible to do something like this:\n        nc +$ARG +-U +/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock\"; su -c \"evil commands\"\n\nDon\u0027t get me wrong, I personnaly dislike how it\u0027s done right now and I\u0027m all open for a new way of treating this.\nWe have an open RFE to address this specific problem. By default, we use the internalapi network for live migration\nand it\u0027s expected to be isolated, so I guess we should be good as far as security is concerned. But I\u0027ll let\nmy colleagues chime in here.",
