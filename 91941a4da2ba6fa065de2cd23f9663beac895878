      "message": "\u003e And regarding the security concern, I believe the the original way is more secure and let me explain:\n\u003e - A rogue ssh client can only execute what it\u0027s able to pass to the remote host.\n\u003e - By strictly checking the command, we make sure they can only execute these specific commands.\n\u003e - Unless they already have access to the host and can overwrite these commands, their impact is pretty limited\n\u003e - By using regex like this, I believe that it\u0027s possible to do something like this:\n\u003e         nc +$ARG +-U +/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock\"; su -c \"evil commands\"\n\nUnless I missed something, that will actually not work because we\nonly look at ``SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND`` (i.e. the command provided by the\nssh client) to decide whether virt-ssh-helper or nc should be used:\nafter that has been determined, the entire script is thrown out and\nwe explicitly call either `virt-ssh-helper qemu:///system` or `nc -U\n/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock`. So there is no possibility for a\nrogue client to inject malicious commands.\n\nI\u0027ve updated the commit message to clarify this further, and of\ncourse addressed the nits you pointed out as well.\n\nThanks a lot for your quick and thorough review! :)",
